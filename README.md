# CRUD-API

Organize all the books from your favorite Authors with this CRUD-API written in GraphQL and Express.

Create, Read, Update and Delete Books and Authors and make this Database your own.

## Usage

First install all the dependencies by running:
npm install
in the project folder.

To run the server, please execute: 
npm run devStart 


You can access the API via graphiql on localhost:5000/graphql.

Happy query! :)

P.S. Next step is to hook it up to MongoDB for persistance, and also to create a simple Frontend.
